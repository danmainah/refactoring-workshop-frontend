# Refactoring Take-Home Assignment (Frontend)

## 🎯 Learning Goals

The primary goal of this exercise is for you to **make a messy codebase more readable** and **bug-free**.

Supporting learning goals are the following:

- Understand the importance of (exploratory) refactoring for learning a new codebase
- Learn the value of applying design principles in code implementation
- Improve ability to refactor an existing codebase

## ❗️ How to use

1. Fork this repository
2. Install dependencies

```sh
$ yarn install
```

3.  Launch development server

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

4. Start refactoring!

## 📋 Requirements

In order to refactor effectively, make sure to fulfill the following requirements.

- [ ] Separate the concerns: data and presentation
- [ ] Rename variables/functions/files/folders to be more semantic
- [ ] Reorder folder structure to include `/pages`, `/store`, `/hooks`
- [ ] Remove unused code (files & folders)

**❗️IMPORTANT: Make sure the behavior and presentation remains the same!**

## ⭐️ Tips for success

If you're stuck, here are some handy tips to help you on your way:

- Google is your friend! Look up any best practices regarding this particular tech stack and try to implement them
- When learning the codebase, play around a bit: remove some code, rewrite in a way that makes sense to you first or add comments that explain what's going on in a file.
- Ask a peer for a second opinion. Perhaps they know something you don't!
